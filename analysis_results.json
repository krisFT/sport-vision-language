We've got Tyrese Haliburton and the Indiana Pacers facing off against Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and the Thunder. The scoreboard shows a close game, only two points separating the teams, and it looks like we're maybe only a couple of minutes into the first quarter. The '2 | INDIANA | DER' might indicate a possession change or some sort of indicator on the scoreboard.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker\": \"Jamie\",\n    \"utterance\": \"That's right, Alex.  This is a great matchup.  Two of the league's brightest young stars going head-to-head.  Haliburton's playmaking ability against Shai's incredible scoring prowess...it's a fascinating clash of styles. That close score early tells me both teams are playing tight defense.  I'd guess that 'DER' might stand for 'Defensive Rebound,' keeping possession in the Pacers' hands, given the '2' next to INDIANA.  Let's see if that possession leads to points.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker\": \"Alex\",\n    \"utterance\": \"Absolutely, Jamie.  Early in the game, every possession counts.  It'll be interesting to see how these two teams adjust as the game progresses.  We are still early in the game so we'll need to see what adjustments are made. Will the Pacers continue to focus on Haliburton's distribution, or will they try to attack the rim more directly against OKC's defense?\"\n  }\n]"
